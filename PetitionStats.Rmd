# Introduction
I was curious about the *EU Referendum Rules triggering a 2nd EU Referendum* petition
visible at https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215. I started downloading
the petition data every 10 mins from 10 am on Sat 25th and later upped the rate
to every 2 mins. There is simple analysis presented below and you will be able
to do more if you want using the data.

## Summary
1. About 95% of signatories are UK residents
2. The petition was receiving about 2000 UK signatures/min at its peak
3. Support is highest in Green (15.9%, n=1) and Lib Dem (6.1%, n=8) constituencies
   but there is then not much of a step down to Con (5.6%) or Lab (5.0%)
4. SNP constituencies (3.1%) are signing at approx half the rate that you might expect
   giving the strong remain vote in Scotland.
5. At a regional level, Scotland (3.2%) and Northern Ireland (3.4%) have signature rates less than half of the South East (6.6%) or London (9.0%)
6. There is a weak but still very significant negative correlation between 
   the proportion of older voters in a constituency and the number of signatures.
7. There is a very strong positive correlation (R^2>0.8) between constituency    level referendum results and the rate of signing the petition.
8. In this model, rates for Wales and especially Scotland were lower
9. I found evidence for about 30,000 dubious signatures using UK post-codes in 2
   constituencies on Sun am. petition.parliament.uk removed these within hours 
   (without any input from me).
10. About 3340 additional fake signatures were added on Mon later afternoon/evening
   with a postcode in the Bracknell constituency.
11. There were a similar number of irregularities in non-UK signatures (at a higher proportional rate since the number of non-UK signatures is only 5% of the total).
I did not analyse these further since they are not relevant to the petition process.

# Load Data

```{r}
# summary data frame
sdf=readRDS("signature_data.rds") 
# list of all raw data
pet_data=readRDS('munged_petition_data.rds')
```

We can get plot the total signatures and get a quick estimate of the number
of signatures per minute since I started collecting data.

```{r, fig.width=9}
library(ggplot2)

qplot(time, total, data=sdf, ylim=c(0,NA), geom='line')
mylm=lm(total~time, data=sdf)
summary(mylm)

```

We can repeat the plot but only with UK signatures since those are the only one
of any relevance with respect to the parliamentary response.

```{r, fig.width=9}
# the same but UK signatures only by using consituency table
sdf$uksigs=sapply(pet_data, function(x) sum(x$data$attributes$signatures_by_constituency$signature_count))

# ggplot needs data in a *tall* rather than wide format
library(tidyr)
sdftall=gather(sdf[-1],count.type, n, -time)

qplot(time, n, col=count.type, data=sdftall, geom='line', 
      ylim=c(0,NA), ylab='signatures', xlab=NULL) +
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, .9))
```

Note that the `r rev(sdf$uksigs)[1]` UK signatures make up 
`r rev(sdf$uksigs)[1]/rev(sdf$total)[1]*100`% of the total.

You can see a couple of obvious dislocations. The up-tick of about 10,000 
non-UK signatures shortly after 3am Sunday obviously looks dubious and is
characterised in further detail below.

## Signatures per min

We can take a look at how the number of signatures per minute has evolved:

```{r, fig.width=9}
with(sdf, 
     qplot(time[-1], 
           diff(total)/(as.integer(diff(time))/60), 
           ylim=c(0,NA),
           ylab="Signatures /min",
           xlab='Time') +
       scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")
     +stat_smooth()
)

```

You can see that there is one outlier of >10,000 signatures per minute, 
corresponding to the blip in non-UK signatures at 3am on Sunday mentioned earlier. There are futher small blips (~1000-1500) on Monday either side of 12:00 but these turn out to be non-UK signatures so I have ignored them.

Let's repeat with UK signatures only:
```{r,  fig.width=9}
with(sdf, 
     qplot(time[-1], 
           diff(uksigs)/(as.integer(diff(time))/60), 
           ylim=c(0,NA),
           ylab="Signatures /min",
           xlab='Time') +
       scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")
     +stat_smooth(method = 'loess', span=.08)
)
```

So I am pleased to report that UK does actually sleep during the small hours of
the morning (though some people seemed to be awake during the early hours of 
Sunday - see below). Overall this looks a reasonable activity profile and shows
that at the peak, UK signatures were coming in at over 2000/min.

## Comparison with constituency level information

**petition.parliament.uk** releases a break down of data by constituency. We can
use this to compare the petition data with constituency information including
party, demographics etc. See Acknowledgements for data sources.
```{r}

by.mps=readRDS('general_election_by.mps.rds')
all.winners <-  by.mps %>% 
  select(Constituency, Votes, Party) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Votes)) %>%
  data.frame()

constituency_names.df <- read.csv("constituency_names.csv", header=TRUE, row.names=1)
all.winners=merge(all.winners, constituency_names.df)

library(readxl)
pop=read_excel("Population-by-age.xlsx", sheet = "Data")
```

Let's list some basic info for the top and bottom 20 constituencies. Note that
sig_rate is the number of signatures per head of population (all ages):
```{r}
euref=pet_data[[length(pet_data)]]

sigdf=euref$data$attributes$signatures_by_constituency
sigdf=merge(sigdf, pop, by.x='ons_code', by.y = 'ONSConstID')
sigdf$sig_rate=sigdf$signature_count/sigdf$PopTotalConstNum

sigdf=merge(sigdf, all.winners, by.x='ons_code', by.y = 'id')
sigdf %>% 
  arrange(desc(sig_rate)) %>% 
  select(c(ons_code:signature_count, sig_rate, Pop65ConstRate, Party)) %>% 
  top_n(20, sig_rate) %>%
  kable
```

```{r}
sigdf %>% 
  arrange(desc(sig_rate)) %>% 
  select(c(ons_code:signature_count, sig_rate, Pop65ConstRate, Party)) %>% 
  top_n(20, desc(sig_rate)) %>%
  kable
```


From which a few interesting points emerge. Most of the top constituencies
are in the Bremain hotspots in London/SE with Con or Lab MPs. 
However interestingly the bottom 20 include 11 SNP constituencies (many of which presumably voted to remain). It looks like the Scots are not involved with this process.

We can look at a summary by Party:

```{r}
sigdf %>%
  group_by(Party) %>%
  summarise(`Mean Sig Rate`=mean(sig_rate), `Constituencies`=length(sig_rate)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Mean Sig Rate`)) %>%
  kable()
```

all of which makes pretty good sense to me (Green and Lib Dem constituencies highest)
Cons/Lab similarly. SNP lower than might be expected as noted above.

We can look at a summary by Region:

```{r}
sigdf %>%
  group_by(RegionName) %>%
  summarise(`Mean Sig Rate`=mean(sig_rate), `Constituencies`=length(sig_rate)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(`Mean Sig Rate`)) %>%
  kable()
```

To my view this re-emphasises the fact that Scotland and Northern Ireland, which
both voted to remain, are not engaging with this petition. However, it may be
that this is not unusual (e.g. maybe they are not interested in petitioning the 
Westminster legislature in general). This needs to be checked with other petitions.

We can compare the signature rate with some demographic data:
```{r}
qplot(data=sigdf, sig_rate, Pop65ConstRate, xlim=c(0,NA), ylim=c(0,NA))+
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
eupet.lm=lm(sig_rate~Pop65ConstRate, data=sigdf)
summary(eupet.lm)
```

As expected constituencies with lower levels of over 65s are signing less.
Now it is possible that some fraction of this effect is because older people
are less likely to engage with the petitions website. Is this true?

### Comparison with EU Pamphlet petition

The petition [STOP CAMERON spending British taxpayers’ money on Pro-EU Referendum leaflets]
(https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/116762)
is on a similar topic but is likely to appeal to out rather than remain voters:

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
eupamphlet.raw=fromJSON("https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/116762.json")
eupamphlet.sigdf=eupamphlet.raw$data$attributes$signatures_by_constituency
# merge in constituency level demographic data used earlier
eupamphlet.sigdf=merge(eupamphlet.sigdf, pop, by.x='ons_code', by.y = 'ONSConstID')
# compute 
eupamphlet.sigdf = mutate(eupamphlet.sigdf, sig_rate=signature_count/PopTotalConstNum)

```

We can then compare the proportion of over 65s in each constituency with the 
rate of signatures:

```{r}
qplot(data=eupamphlet.sigdf, sig_rate, Pop65ConstRate/`Pop20-64ConstRate`, xlim=c(0,NA), ylim=c(0,NA))+
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
eupamhlet.lm=lm(sig_rate~I(Pop65ConstRate/`Pop20-64ConstRate`), data=eupamphlet.sigdf)
summary(eupamhlet.lm)
```

Indeed there is a strong positive correlation (R^2=.45) and the effect size is much
stronger than the negative correlation for the 2nd EU referendum signature.

### Comparison with Jeremy Hunt Petition
Ideally one would try to scrape as many of the petitions as possible to provide
a baseline, but for the time being I just took one other large petition that
did not strike me as being particularly likely to result in an age divide.
```{r}
library(jsonlite)
jhunt.raw=fromJSON("https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/121152.json")
jhunt.sigdf=jhunt.raw$data$attributes$signatures_by_constituency
# merge in constituency level demographic data used earlier
jhunt.sigdf=merge(jhunt.sigdf, pop, by.x='ons_code', by.y = 'ONSConstID')
# compute 
jhunt.sigdf = mutate(jhunt.sigdf, sig_rate=signature_count/PopTotalConstNum)
```

We can then compare the proportion of over 65s in each constituency with the 
rate of signatures:

```{r}
qplot(data=jhunt.sigdf, sig_rate, Pop65ConstRate, xlim=c(0,NA), ylim=c(0,NA))+
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
jhunt.lm=lm(sig_rate~Pop65ConstRate, data=jhunt.sigdf)
summary(jhunt.lm)
```

Now if you look at linear model summaries, you'll see that the slope of the negative
relationship for the euref petition is almost 15x greater than the Hunt petition.
This support an asymmetry in the petition age profile consistent with the much 
higher levels of support for leave voters.

```{r}
coef(eupet.lm)/coef(jhunt.lm)
```

All of which suggests to me that there appears to be a real negative relationship between 
age and proportion of petition signatures on this new referendum petition. 

# Comparison with Referendum Predictions

Let's load up the referendum data from the electoral commission 
## Referendum data

```{r}
# euref <- read.csv("http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/file/0014/212135/EU-referendum-result-data.csv")
euref <- readRDS('EU-referendum-result-data.rds')
```

Now the problem is that the referendum was reported not by constituencies but by
regions, but maybe we can match up some of these as a starting point.

```{r}
nrow(euref)
inboth=intersect(sigdf$ConstituencyName, euref$Area)
length(inboth)
```

OK so `r length(inboth)` referendum regions and constituencies have the same name.

Let's use these matches to look at some relationships:

```{r}
sigdf2=merge(sigdf, euref, by.x='ConstituencyName', by.y='Area')
qplot(data=sigdf2,Pct_Remain,sig_rate)+geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Hmm, there are some points that are rather separated from the rest. Just a hunch,
but let's model the different member countries of the UK separately.

```{r}
qplot(data=sigdf2,Pct_Remain,sig_rate*100, col=Nation, 
      xlab="Percent Voting Remain", ylab='Percent Signing Petition',
      main=paste("Petition vs Referendum Results for",nrow(sigdf2), "UK Constituencies"))+
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')+
  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, .8), legend.title=element_blank())
```

Yup, very large difference between Scotland and England / Wales. We can also look
at the terms in the linear model that reflect this:

```{r}
euref.lm=lm(sig_rate~Pct_Remain+Nation,data=sigdf2)
euref.lm
summary(euref.lm)
```

Note that this full model has a very high R^2 >0.8. So, not that surprisingly, it seems that the knowing how people voted in the referendum
is a very strong predictor of whether they signed this petition. Residuals
in either direction might be evidence of regret (which polls have suggested to 2-3x more common in leave than remain voters). There looks to be a small
up-tick in constituencies that were overwhelmingly for leave.
However further work is required to match up constituency level data with referendum areas before drawing stronger conclusions.


## Irregularities

I was initially concerned at the linearity of the rate of signature growth during 
the day (wondering if this might actually be an artefact of the back-end computer 
systems operating close to capacity), but so far I 
have not only found evidence of limited irregularities in the UK data.
Investigation on Sunday (26 June) morning of the activity 
found two constituencies where something odd has happened. I found these
by dividing the data up by constituency and correlating the rate of signature
growth by constituency with the national average. One of these was very obvious:
the constituency with the most signatures, **Cities of London and Westminster**,
had an implausibly large amount of activity overnight (unless there are a load of
traders in Hong Kong ...)

Overall this leads me to suggest that at the time of initial  writing ~30,000
out of 2787004 UK signatures (~1.1%) might be invalid.

For what it's worth the petitions team removed these fake signatures at around
2pm on Sunday.

Collect data
```{r}
all_sigcounts=t(sapply(pet_data,function(x) x$data$attributes$signatures_by_constituency$signature_count))
colnames(all_sigcounts)=pet_data[[1]]$data$attributes$signatures_by_constituency$name
rownames(all_sigcounts)=sdf$time
all_sigcounts=cbind(sdf['time'], all_sigcounts)
```

Now let's calculate the correlation of all constituencies vs the UK average and 
look for discrepancies
```{r}
library(dplyr)
cor_vs_totaluk=apply(all_sigcounts[,-1], 2, cor, sdf$total)
data.frame(constit=names(cor_vs_totaluk), cor=cor_vs_totaluk)  %>%
  arrange(cor) %>%
  top_n(10, desc(cor)) %>%
  kable
```

A histogram makes these two outliers pretty obvious:

```{r}
hist(cor_vs_totaluk, col='red', breaks=50)
hist(cor_vs_totaluk, col='red', breaks=50, ylim=c(0,50))
```


We can plot the data for the 2 dubious constituencies 

```{r}
qplot(time, `Cities of London and Westminster`,data=all_sigcounts)+
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")
qplot(time, `Worsley and Eccles South`,data=all_sigcounts) + 
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")
```

which shows both the suspicious night time activity and its correction.

For comparison here are the 3rd and 9th constituencies (with much higher correlation scores):
```{r}
qplot(time, `Rhondda`,data=all_sigcounts) + 
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")

qplot(time, `St Ives`,data=all_sigcounts) + 
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")
```

## (A few) more fake signatures
On Tues, I spotted another attempt to add fake signatures with 
post-code(s) in Bracknell. This took place late on Monday afternoon/evening.

```{r}
qplot(time, `Bracknell`,data=all_sigcounts) + 
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours")
```

This may be more obvious if we plot as signatures / minute.
```{r}
with(all_sigcounts,
     qplot(time[-1], diff(`Bracknell`)/diff(as.integer(time)/60),
           xlab=NULL, ylab='Signatures/minute') + geom_smooth(method='loess', span=.08)+
  scale_x_datetime(date_labels="%a %H:%M", date_breaks="6 hours"))

```

We can add a prediction of what the data should have looked like by calculating
a linear model of Bracknell vs the whole UK before the spike and then applying
that to the a smoothed version of the whole UK data. 

```{r}
bdf=mutate(sdf, Bracknell=all_sigcounts$Bracknell)
brack.lm=lm(Bracknell~0+uksigs, data=subset(bdf, time<ISOdatetime(2016,6,27,14,0,0, tz='Europe/London')))

all.smooth=loess(uksigs~as.integer(time), data=sdf, span=0.08)
bdf$Bracknell.pred=all.smooth$fitted*coef(brack.lm)

plot(Bracknell~time,data=bdf)
lines(Bracknell.pred~time, data=bdf, col='red', lwd=2)

```

And the (pretty precisely) estimated number of fake signatures is:

```{r}
nfakesigs=with(subset(bdf, time>ISOdatetime(2016,6,28,0,0,0, tz='Europe/London')),
     c(mean=mean(Bracknell-Bracknell.pred), sd=sd(Bracknell-Bracknell.pred)))
```

ie. `r nfakesigs['mean']` (+/- `r nfakesigs['sd']` sd) or `r nfakesigs['mean']/max(sdf$uksigs)*100`
% of the total UK sigs.

## Personal 
For the record, I am a scientist and I voted remain because in my view that was
objectively the best decision for the country and my own profession.
